"""Inspect repo-local multi-agent Codex loop state.

This helper is read-only. It summarizes whether the project has enough durable
state to hand off work, continue a request, or auto-chain a next session.

It also enforces the hardened loop engineering invariants:

- goal/tracker/constraints/handoff must already exist (bootstrap creates them);
- per-lane ``heartbeat`` is parsed and stale heartbeats are flagged as
  ``orphan-suspect`` against ``--stale-heartbeat-mins`` (default 30);
- ``loop-budget.md`` is read and a ``budget_exhausted: true`` flag warns;
- FIX_REQUESTED<->IMPLEMENTING iterations per request are counted and warned
  when they exceed ``max_fix_cycles`` from ``loop-policy.md`` (anti-thrash);
- ``loop-run-log.md`` and ``evidence/`` presence is checked;
- ``evidence_recorded_ok`` is true only when every non-terminal request has at
  least one real ``evidence/*.json`` record; message pointers never count;
- ``completion_gate_ok`` runs the real deterministic gate: it imports
  ``completion_gate`` in-process (never a subprocess), loads ``evidence/*.json``
  once, and evaluates every distinct ``request_id`` that appears in the RECORDS
  themselves -- NOT only the non-terminal rows of ``requests.md``. Any record
  whose ``exit_code`` is not a clean 0 flips the flag and names that
  ``request_id`` in ``gate_failed_requests``, whether or not the request is
  registered in ``requests.md`` and whether or not it is terminal: a terminal
  ACCEPTED request with failing evidence is exactly the lie this gate exists to
  catch. Registered requests at IMPLEMENTATION_DONE or later are evaluated even
  with zero records, so the doctor agrees with the standalone gate's fail-closed
  result. It is true only when the gate is importable, no required or recorded
  request failed, and no evidence file was malformed. If
  ``completion_gate`` cannot be imported the doctor still runs, sets
  ``gate_available`` false, and emits a ``gate_unavailable`` warning;
- decision-memory drift is checked against ``memory/decisions.jsonl`` using the
  single canonical ``normalize_then_hash`` imported from ``record_decision``.
  Every finding (``stale_decision``, ``missing_source_doc``,
  ``malformed_decision``) is a WARNING only and NEVER affects ``handoff_ready``
  or ``auto_chain_ready``: the memory cache is fail-open, the completion gate is
  fail-closed. An absent ``decisions.jsonl`` degrades gracefully to zero
  warnings; ``decisions`` reports ``{total, active, stale, malformed}``.
- G3/G35 human-QA hold: a user-facing slice held awaiting a human sign-off (a
  ``human_qa_hold:`` run-log note, or legacy ``human_qa_requested:`` prose, with
  no matching ``human_qa: confirmed`` note for the same request_id) is NORMAL WAITING, so ``stalled_handoff`` is
  suppressed for it. The hold is read from the append-only ``loop-run-log.md``
  (durable), not from the mutable ``next_action`` cell. Exposed as
  ``held_for_human_qa``.
- G7 lineage/hygiene checks, all WARNING-only (never touch handoff/auto-chain):
  ``orphan_evidence`` (an evidence file naming a request_id with no row in
  requests.md; SETUP-* records are legitimate), ``evidence_naming`` (an evidence
  filename matching neither the flat REQ contract nor SETUP-*), and
  ``uncommitted_work`` (when git is present AND every request is terminal or
  BLOCKED, a non-exempt dirty/untracked file under a lane's write_scope, named
  with the owning lane). ``uncommitted_work`` is the one check that shells out to
  ``git status --porcelain``; that call is isolated, timed out, and fails
  silent-safe (any failure -> no warning). It is skipped entirely when git is
  absent.
- G26 evidence-manifest coverage: every dispatched request must have an archived
  IMPLEMENTATION_REQUEST with backticked VERIFY commands, and every declared
  command must be covered by a real evidence record. Gaps are reported as
  ``evidence_manifest_gap`` warnings.
- G22 write-scope discipline, both WARNING-only (never touch handoff/auto-chain):
  ``write_scope_overlap`` (two lanes whose normalized write_scope globs overlap --
  one equals or prefix-contains another -- naming both lanes and the offending
  globs; a lane's OWN ``docs/loop/lanes/<lane>/**`` dir is exempt, being the
  by-design nesting under product's ``docs/loop/**`` ledger, mirroring the G19
  ritual-write carve-out) and ``product_scope_gap`` (a lane named ``product``
  whose scope does not cover ``docs/loop/**``, the ledger it must commit).
- G28 defect-class schema: every archived ``FIX_REQUEST*.md`` should carry a
  ``defect_class:`` line. Older archived loops predate the field, so a missing
  line emits ``fix_request_class_missing`` as a WARNING only.
- G31 BLOCKED lifecycle: ``BLOCKED`` is a pause, while ``ACCEPTED`` and
  ``ABANDONED`` are terminal. A ``BLOCKED -> FIX_REQUESTED`` run-log exit with
  no recorded human authorization emits ``blocked_exit_unauthorized`` as a
  WARNING only.
- G35 lifecycle bookkeeping: the structured ``human_qa_hold:`` marker and the
  legacy ``human_qa_requested:`` prose both suppress false stalls; a non-default
  fix cap without an Active append-only override emits ``override_history_gap``;
  and a resumed-round FIX_REQUEST without ``cap_authorization:`` emits
  ``fix_request_cap_authorization_missing``. All are file-level checks.
- G32 evidence-chain checks are WARNING-only: ``evidence_mirror_gap`` names a
  root evidence record at IMPLEMENTATION_DONE or beyond that has no
  byte-identical copy in the implementing lane's evidence directory, and
  ``gate_evidence_missing`` names an ACCEPTED iteration with no recorded,
  request-scoped completion-gate invocation.
- G33 human-QA durability: each structured ``human_qa_hold:`` row and legacy
  ``human_qa_requested:`` row needs a matching durable message addressed with
  ``to_lane: human``. Missing round messages emit
  ``human_qa_message_missing`` as a WARNING only.
- G34 reserved infrastructure ports: when constraints.md declares them, a URL
  on one of those ports in goal.md or docs/product/*.md emits
  ``reserved_port_advertised`` as a WARNING. Older loops with no declaration
  skip the check cleanly.

    A user-facing slice, after REVIEW_DONE, HOLDS at REVIEWING while product asks

    for user-facing slices"). The hold is recorded durably in the append-only

    releases the hold is a later ``human_qa: confirmed`` note for the same
    request_id. Older free-text ``human_qa_requested:`` notes remain recognized.

    ``next_action`` marker is overwritten on every transition and would silently
    lose the hold, whereas the run-log marker survives. A hold note activates the

    #    lane demonstrably finished ITS OWN work (gate green on its deliverable),

    #    evidence proves the IMPLEMENTATION finished, NOT that the review did.

    #    review, so this signal is true for the ENTIRE healthy review; firing
