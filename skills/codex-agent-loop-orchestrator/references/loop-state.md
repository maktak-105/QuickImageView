# Loop State Gates

This file is the reference implementation of the handoff, lanes, coordinated-writes, and bounded-loop invariants (`references/methodology.md`): the specific gates below are one concrete shape of those invariants. Any individual gate is swappable; "every boundary must have some gate" is not.

Use this reference to decide when to start loop engineering, when to hand off, and when to create or continue another Codex session.

## Request Lifecycle

**BLOCKED is a human-gate pause, not a terminal state.** It has exactly one
legal edge back into work: `BLOCKED -> FIX_REQUESTED`, carrying a recorded human
authorization in `loop-run-log.md`. The authorizing row note is exactly
`human_authorization: approved` or starts with
`human_authorization: approved | ` followed by an evidence pointer. No lane may
resume a blocked request into another working state.

**ACCEPTED is the success terminal.** `ABANDONED` is the explicit
human-declared dead-end terminal. A request may move `BLOCKED -> ABANDONED` only
on a recorded human decision; this is a terminal disposition rather than a
resume edge, and `ABANDONED` rows keep their evidence.

**loop-run-log.md is the authoritative transition history.** **requests.md is a
coarse current-state snapshot at checkpoint granularity;** `PLANNED` and
`IMPLEMENTATION_DONE` may never appear in it - that is legal. Recovery and
audits reconstruct intermediate edges from the append-only run log.

## Loop Start Gate

Start a repo-local loop only when all required conditions are true:

```text
clear goal + checkpointable work + verification surface + durable state need
```

Required:

- The objective has a concrete `Done When`.
- The work can be split into checkpoints.
- There is a verification surface: tests, build, screenshots, review checklist, rendered artifact, source evidence, or manual acceptance criteria.
- State needs to survive compaction, app restart, or a different lane/thread.
- Constraints and non-goals are known enough to prevent drift.

Do not start loop engineering for a tiny one-off edit, a vague idea without acceptance criteria, or a task that requires credentials, production actions, deletion, billing changes, or private external data without approval.

### Task-Size Gate

Before starting a loop, size the task. If the work plausibly fits **one session** - roughly under two hours, one agent, low audit/recoverability need, and no sensitive-data gates - say so and **recommend a direct session instead of a loop**. The loop's process cost (evidence trail, independent review, durable handoff state) only pays for itself on multi-session, multi-agent, sensitive-data-gated, or must-survive-compaction work. Spinning up a loop for a one-shot MVP makes the task more complicated than it is.

### Intake, Not A Placeholder Block

When `goal.md`/`Done When` still hold bootstrap placeholders, there is **no objective yet, which is the ABSENCE of a request** - not a blocked request. Run an intake conversation with the human (objective + Done-When; build-the-software vs be-the-operations-team; discipline-cut vs feature-cut) and create the first request **only after** the human answers. Never mint a `PLANNED -> BLOCKED` "no goal yet" placeholder request: a red BLOCKED row before first contact misreports absence as failure.

**Intake is a grilling interview, not a questionnaire.** Ask ONE question at a time and wait for the answer before the next (a bulk list loses the dependency order between answers); attach the coordinator's OWN recommended answer to every question so the human edits a proposal instead of authoring cold; look up any fact the repo or host can answer (stack, test runner, existing UI surface, whether a tool is installed) rather than asking - reserve questions for genuine decisions. **Stop rule:** when the objective is checkable (a concrete Done-When is in hand), stop asking and write `goal.md` - do not over-interview. For a **user-facing goal**, one question is MANDATORY: *"walk me through how you'll actually operate this - input method, file selection, what you look at first"* (the file-picker-vs-path-textbox gap dies here). This preserves the F3/F5 intake semantics (no placeholder BLOCKED, the task-size gate, and the two forks) and only sharpens HOW the questions are asked.

**Hybrid intake: cap the serial questions, batch the independent rest.** One-at-a-time is the default ONLY for **fork-shaped** decisions (an answer that changes which later questions you ask). After at most three serial questions the coordinator MUST offer questionnaire mode - one message listing every remaining INDEPENDENT decision, each with its recommended answer, answered in one reply - and the human may ask for the whole list at any time ("list them all", in any language), switching immediately, even before the third question. Only independent items go in the batch: a decision whose answer would change another item is held back and asked serially AFTER the batch resolves. Questionnaire mode changes only the delivery; G9's recommended-answer rule and the stop rule are unchanged.

**Invariants-first intake.** For any goal that handles data or multi-step processing, right after the objective is confirmed the coordinator asks the human for the domain **invariants** (the rules that must never break) and DRAFTS a recommended set from the goal for the human to edit - no silent drops (every parsed record lands in the raw store even if unclassifiable or duplicate-suspected), human edits outrank machine re-runs, add-only ingest (dedupe marks/merges, never deletes), external-effect operations carry a `run_id` and recoverable state, every displayed number traces to its source file/row/rule. The agreed invariants live in `goal.md` under a dedicated `## Invariants` section (the canonical location); the request template lists which apply per slice and the review gate checks changed behavior against them. Worked example: the run-4 expense app (transactions never silently dropped; human category/duplicate corrections survive re-import; add-only ingest; per-import `run_id` + undo; every dashboard number traceable).

## Checkpoint Close Gate

A checkpoint is closed enough to hand off only when:

- The current lane completed one coherent slice.
- Changed files or produced artifacts are listed.
- Verification ran, or the reason it could not run is explicit.
- `tracker.md`, `handoff.md`, `requests.md`, and lane `current.md` reflect the latest state.
- The next action can be written as one clear request.
- Blockers and risks are documented.

If any item is missing, continue in the current session until the checkpoint can be audited.

### In-Turn Report-Back (mandatory before the turn ends)

Codex threads run one turn and stop, so the handoff must finish inside the same
turn as the work: **close the turn**. The full step list is defined once in
`references/protocol.md` ("Close the turn") - read it there and do not restate
it here. Do not end the turn after the work (even after `SHIP_CHECK_OK`) with
the reply, ledger, run-log, or heartbeat left undone: there is no guaranteed
next turn, and the requester will wait forever. The doctor reports a
done-but-unadvanced request as `stalled_handoff`.

## Handoff Readiness Gate

Use this decision tree before sending work to another lane:

```text
Is there a concrete next actor?
  no -> continue current session or ask product to decide
  yes -> continue

Is the current checkpoint closed?
  no -> verify/update state first
  yes -> continue

Can the next actor act from repo files + message alone?
  no -> improve docs/handoff first
  yes -> continue

Is the target lane registered and verified?
  yes -> send_message_to_thread
  no -> create/verify/register thread, or write inbox fallback

Would this cause concurrent writes to the same files?
  yes -> serialize through product or stop
  no -> hand off
```

Handoff is ready when the next agent does not need hidden chat history to continue.

## Lane Expansion Gate

Add a lane only when all are true:

- It owns a recurring responsibility, not a one-off task.
- It has clear inputs and outputs.
- Its write scope can be separated from active lanes.
- It reduces context pollution or enables real parallel work.
- Product can route work to it with a concrete message and acceptance criteria.
- Its worklog will be useful for later recovery or accountability.

Do not add a lane when the proposed agent overlaps an existing lane, has no durable output, needs to edit the same files as another active lane, or exists only as a personality label.

Common lane presets:

| lane | role | default write scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| research | Do source-backed research and summarize findings. | `docs/research/**; docs/loop/lanes/research/**` |
| visual | Review UI/visual output and prepare visual asset requests. | `docs/design/**; docs/loop/lanes/visual/**` |
| security | Review security risks, threat models, and sensitive changes. | `docs/security/**; docs/loop/lanes/security/**` |
| data | Analyze metrics, datasets, experiments, and validation evidence. | `docs/data/**; docs/loop/lanes/data/**` |
| docs | Maintain docs, changelogs, release notes, and user-facing copy. | `docs/user/**; CHANGELOG.md; docs/loop/lanes/docs/**` |
| release | Coordinate release readiness, QA checklist, packaging, and blockers. | `docs/release/**; docs/loop/lanes/release/**` |
| media | Coordinate scripts, covers, videos, and social-content assets. | `docs/media/**; docs/loop/lanes/media/**` |

If a preset write scope is too broad for the project, add a custom lane with a narrower `--extra-lane` entry instead.

## Lease Gate

Lanes coordinate writes two ways: a static `write_scope` per lane in
`agent-lanes.md`, and dynamic, short-lived **advisory leases** in
`docs/loop/leases.md`. Use a lease when a lane needs temporary exclusive
ownership of files that overlap, or could overlap, another lane's scope for the
lifetime of one request.

### leases.md schema

```md
| file_glob | lane | request_id | acquired_at | status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| src/payments/** | implementation | REQ-20260624-101500-implementation | 2026-06-24T10:15:00Z | active |
```

- `file_glob`: a single glob (fnmatch syntax; `**` for recursion) the lease
  covers. One glob per row; add multiple rows for multiple paths.
- `lane`: the lane that holds the lease. Must be a registered lane.
- `request_id`: the request the lease serves, so recovery can tie a lease back
  to live work in `requests.md`.
- `acquired_at`: ISO-8601 UTC timestamp the lease was taken.
- `status`: `active`/`held` is enforced; `released`/`expired`/`done`/`revoked`/`stale`
  or a blank status is ignored; any other non-blank value is treated as held, so
  the guard fails closed on a status it does not recognize.

Leases are advisory: they live in a repo file and are only as honest as the
lanes that write them. Acquire a lease by appending an `active` row before you
start editing; release it by setting the row's `status` to `released` (do not
delete the row, so the history stays auditable). Never edit another lane's
active lease row except to mark a verifiably stale one and only after
coordinating through product.

### How write_scope is enforced

`write_scope` is enforced mechanically by a git **pre-commit hook**, not by
trust. Install it once per repo:

```bash
python <skill_dir>/scripts/install_precommit.py --repo . --loop-dir docs/loop
```

The hook runs `precommit_scope_guard.py`, which reads the committing lane from
the `CODEX_LANE` environment variable, then rejects the commit (exit 1) if any
staged file is either:

- outside the committing lane's `write_scope` globs in `agent-lanes.md`, or
- covered by an **active lease held by a different lane** in `leases.md`.

Commit with the lane set - POSIX `CODEX_LANE=implementation git commit -m "..."`;
PowerShell `$env:CODEX_LANE = 'implementation'; git commit -m "..."`.
With no lane set the guard fails closed (the commit is blocked) unless
`CODEX_PRECOMMIT_SKIP=1` is exported (POSIX `CODEX_PRECOMMIT_SKIP=1 git commit ...`,
an inline one-shot; PowerShell `$env:CODEX_PRECOMMIT_SKIP = 1; git commit ...;
Remove-Item Env:CODEX_PRECOMMIT_SKIP` - remove it afterwards, or every later
commit in the session keeps bypassing the guard) - the one skip
mechanism the installed hook honors. (`precommit_scope_guard.py` also accepts
`--allow-unscoped`, but only for direct manual invocations of the guard script:
the installed hook never passes that flag, and `install_precommit.py` does not
accept it, so it cannot unblock a real commit.) Free-text notes in a
`write_scope` cell (for example
`implementation notes named by request`) are ignored for matching; only
path/glob tokens constrain the commit.

### Lease Gate checklist

Before editing files that another lane could touch:

- Acquire a lease in `leases.md` with `status: active` tied to your
  `request_id`, or confirm the files are already inside your `write_scope` and
  unclaimed.
- Do not edit files held by another lane's active lease; route the change
  through that lane via `requests.md` instead.
- Release the lease (`status: released`) at checkpoint close, in the same
  update that moves `requests.md` and lane `current.md`.
- Treat a pre-commit rejection as a coordination signal, not a tooling error:
  restage only in-scope files, or hand the file to its owning lane.

## Product To Implementation Gate

Send `IMPLEMENTATION_REQUEST` only after product has:

- named source docs;
- defined scope and **non-empty non-goals** - a request whose `non_goals` is
  empty is NOT ready to send. An empty Out-of-Scope gives review no written
  boundary to enforce and invites gold-plating; name at least one thing the
  slice will deliberately not do;
- copied acceptance criteria, **each naming its red-capable verify command**
  (see `references/protocol.md` "Red-capable acceptance criteria"): a criterion
  whose named command cannot FAIL on that criterion's violation is a vibe -
  sharpen it or drop it before sending;
- **when `goal.md` names human-provided real data** (a real statement, export,
  or invoice), included at least one criterion asserting **field-level
  correctness** against it or a human-approved redacted derivative - row count
  > 0, valid ISO calendar dates, merchant/payee non-empty and non-numeric, and
  the document's sign convention. "Parses without error" alone is never
  sufficient real-data evidence. The check runs against the redacted sample the
  human approved once at intake, and evidence records only counts/booleans (see
  `references/protocol.md` "Real-input correctness" and its redacted-sample
  ritual);
- **listed which invariants apply** to this slice (by number/name from
  `goal.md`'s `## Invariants` section) or stated that none apply and why; each
  applicable invariant, like each criterion, names a red-capable verify command
  that FAILS on its violation (see `references/protocol.md` "Applicable
  invariants per request");
- confirmed the implementation write scope does not conflict with another active lane;
- created or updated the request row in `requests.md`.

## Implementation To Review Gate

Send `REVIEW_REQUEST` only after implementation has:

- completed a runnable or reviewable slice;
- listed changed files and artifacts;
- run the requested verification or explained why it could not run;
- **from request 1**, written every per-command evidence JSON under
  `docs/loop/lanes/<lane>/evidence/` and handed those exact bytes to product for
  the flat `docs/loop/evidence/` mirror. Product confirms each pair is
  **byte-for-byte** identical before routing review; equal filenames or parsed
  values do not establish the mirror. This standing rule is independent of the
  artifact type and applies to every project from its first request;
- sent `IMPLEMENTATION_DONE`;
- updated its worklog/current state.

The root directory is the completion gate's canonical flat input; the lane
directory preserves producer lineage. A root record for a request at
`IMPLEMENTATION_DONE` or beyond without an identical implementing-lane copy is
an `evidence_mirror_gap` warning, not a new lifecycle status or a change to gate
verdict semantics. See `references/protocol.md` "Evidence Records" for the one
record schema and dual-write contract.

## Review To Fix Gate

Send `FIX_REQUEST` only when review can state:

- exact failed criteria;
- evidence path, command, screenshot, or artifact;
- a bounded requested fix;
- the same `request_id` with incremented `iteration`.

Do not rewrite product scope during review. Send `BLOCKED` to product if criteria are ambiguous.

### Pre-Implementation Contract Freeze Gate

For a defect-class closure round, `FIX_REQUESTED` may be owned by review while
review handles a `PRE_IMPLEMENTATION_TEST_REQUEST`. Review freezes the
implementation-independent red-capable enumeration, records its artifact path
and SHA-256, and demonstrates the contract can go red before implementation.
Only then does review dispatch the `FIX_REQUEST` and transfer ownership to the
implementation lane. A review-owned `FIX_REQUESTED` snapshot is therefore a
first-class contract-freeze phase, not an ambiguous owner mismatch.

### Review checklist (three named categories)

Every review evaluates the slice against three named categories, not just
per-criterion pass/fail:

1. **Unmet or partial criteria** - any acceptance criterion whose red-capable
   command did not pass, or passed only in part.
2. **Scope creep** - changed files or behavior OUTSIDE the request's declared
   `scope`/`non_goals`, flagged **even if it works**. The mechanical yardstick
   is the request's `scope` globs: compare the `changed_files` against them, and
   any changed file that no `scope` glob covers (or that a `non_goals` line
   forbids) is scope creep. Run 2's out-of-scope pie chart and direct-ask
   restyle were both this category, and review never named it.

   **Protocol-mandated ritual writes are exempt.** The close-the-turn ritual
   REQUIRES certain loop-file writes on every slice, so the comparison is
   `changed_files` vs the request's `scope` globs PLUS this standing exemption
   list - these writes are never scope creep:

   - the lane's OWN heartbeat cell in `agent-lanes.md`;
   - the request's row in `requests.md`;
   - appended `loop-run-log.md` rows;
   - the lane's own `lanes/<lane>/**` files (current.md, worklog.md, workspace);
   - `messages/<request_id>/**` envelopes for the request under review;
   - `evidence/**` records for the request under review.

   Writes to OTHER lanes' rows or directories remain creep - one lane editing
   another lane's registry row, `current.md`, or messages is exactly what this
   check exists to catch. Canonical non-creep example (run 3): review blocked
   data-eng for stamping its own `agent-lanes.md` heartbeat cell - a write the
   close-the-turn ritual REQUIRES. A correctly-closed turn must never be
   condemned for its own ritual writes.
3. **Looks-done-but-wrong** - criteria that appear satisfied but produce a
   wrong result (the tautological-evidence class: green command, garbage output).

### Ease-of-misuse question (standing, mandatory)

Beyond per-criterion pass/fail, every review answers one standing question and
records the answer in `REVIEW_DONE`:

> **Ease-of-misuse:** can a caller or input reach a wrong-but-accepted outcome
> the criteria did not forbid? Name the path, or state "none found."

This is the UNC-path class: run 2's localhost guard blocked `://` but not UNC
network-share paths, and only a diligent reviewer caught it. Making the question
mandatory turns that lucky catch into a required lens.

### Finding severity (blocker | should-fix | nit)

Each `FIX_REQUEST` finding carries a `severity`: `blocker`, `should-fix`, or
`nit`.

- **Only a `blocker` forces a fix cycle.** A blocker means a criterion is unmet,
  scope creep shipped, or a misuse path is reachable - the slice cannot be
  accepted as-is. Send `FIX_REQUEST`, keep the same `request_id`, and increment
  `iteration`.
- **`should-fix` and `nit` do NOT force a fix cycle.** They may be
  accepted-with-notes (recorded in `REVIEW_DONE`'s `remaining_risks`, carried
  into a follow-up request) or batched. **`iteration` increments only for
  blockers** - a review that finds nothing but nits does not bounce the request
  back and does not increment `iteration`. This cools the fix-cycle rate without
  weakening review: a nitpick and a privacy hole no longer carry equal blocking
  weight.

When review finds only `should-fix`/`nit` items (no blocker), it may send
`REVIEW_DONE` with the notes attached rather than `FIX_REQUEST`.

Every `REVIEW_DONE` carries review's pass/fail `verdict` and leaves the request
at `REVIEWING`; product alone performs the `ACCEPTED` transition. A user-facing
request first passes the Human-QA Gate below.

### Invariant check (a violation is always a blocker)

Beyond the three categories above, every review checks the slice's CHANGED
behavior against `goal.md`'s `## Invariants` section - the domain rules the
human approved at intake (see `SKILL.md` "Invariants-first intake"). For each
invariant the request marked applicable, confirm the change does not break it;
for a data or multi-step-processing slice, also watch for a newly reachable
violation the request did not list.

An invariant violation is always a blocker. It feeds the severity tiers above -
a dropped record, a re-import that clobbers a human correction, a silent delete,
an un-undoable external effect, or a displayed number that traces to nothing is
never a should-fix or a nit. Send `FIX_REQUEST` with `severity: blocker`, keep
the same `request_id`, and increment `iteration`.

### Tautological-evidence guard (reject evidence that cannot go red)

A green exit code only counts when the command that produced it is
**red-capable** - able to FAIL on the criterion's violation. Review must reject
evidence whose command cannot distinguish a correct result from garbage output,
even though it exited `0`. Ask of every evidence record: *if the code were
wrong in the way the criterion forbids, would this exact command go red?* If the
answer is no, the evidence is tautological - it proves the code ran, not that it
is correct - and review sends `FIX_REQUEST` demanding a red-capable command, not
`REVIEW_DONE`.

The canonical case is run 2's `REQ-20260707-073729-data-eng`: its
`td-pdf-smoke` evidence recorded `exit_code: 0` while the app produced
`merchant="9"`, `date="2026-06-00"`, and 0 imported rows. The smoke exercised
the plumbing without asserting a single field value, so it passed on garbage.
Field-level assertions (row count > 0, valid ISO calendar dates, merchant
non-empty and non-numeric, amount sign) are what make such a command go red -
see `references/protocol.md` ("Real-input correctness").

## Human-QA Gate (user-facing slices)

A request whose deliverable is **human-operated** (a UI slice, a dashboard, an
interactive CLI - anything marked `user_facing: true` on the request envelope or
its goal/tracker checkpoint) does NOT reach `ACCEPTED` on machine evidence alone.
The machine gate is unchanged and still runs FIRST; the human sign-off is
additive and applies only to user-facing slices.

Flow (all within existing status tokens and schema - no new column, no new
status):

- After `REVIEW_DONE`, product asks the human to **operate the feature** in one
  message naming the URL/launch command + a 30-second try.
- The request HOLDS: status stays `REVIEWING`, `next_action` reads
  `awaiting human sign-off: <try>`, and a run-log row records
  a note that starts with `human_qa_hold: <try>`. The tracker checkpoint stays
  `[~]`, never `[x]`.
- On the human's confirmation, product records a run-log row
  `human_qa: confirmed <who/when>` BEFORE moving the request to `ACCEPTED` and
  marking the checkpoint `[x]`.

A request holding for human QA is **normal waiting, not a stall**. The doctor
recognizes it by the `human_qa_hold:` run-log row with no matching `human_qa:
confirmed` row for that `request_id`, and suppresses `stalled_handoff` for it -
the held request is the HUMAN's turn (the dashboard's
result-awaiting-confirmation state), not a lane to nudge. Older free-text
`human_qa_requested:` notes remain recognized as an additive compatibility
path. See `references/protocol.md` "Human-QA gate for user-facing slices".

## Auto-Chain Gate

Create a continuation session only when all are true:

- `auto_chain_next_session: true` is present in `handoff.md` or `loop-policy.md`.
- The tracker has unchecked work.
- The next checkpoint is specific and scoped.
- The current checkpoint is verified or explicitly blocked with a safe next action.
- The completion gate is available and the doctor's `completion_gate_ok` is true.
- The archived IMPLEMENTATION_REQUEST VERIFY manifest has no
  `evidence_manifest_gap`; every declared command has an evidence record.
- State files and message ledgers are updated before session creation.
- No blocker needs human input, credentials, external data, destructive action, or production deployment.
- No active verified thread already owns the same `request_id + lane + checkpoint`.
- Replacement has not already been attempted for this continuation.

If any condition fails, stop and report the next required human or repo-state action.

## Budget Stop Gate

Before implementing a request, auto-chaining, or starting a new checkpoint, check `docs/loop/loop-budget.md`.

Core rule:

```text
budget_exhausted: true -> stop, mark BLOCKED, report remaining work
```

- `loop-budget.md` tracks the iteration/cost budget and a `budget_exhausted` flag.
- When `budget_exhausted: true`, do not send new `IMPLEMENTATION_REQUEST`s, do not auto-chain, and do not open a continuation thread. Move the active request to `BLOCKED` and append the transition to the run log.
- Report spent versus budget and the next action a human can authorize (raise budget, re-scope, or stop).
- Treat budget exhaustion like any other human gate: it requires explicit approval to resume.

### Cap-Raise Override History

A cap raise is two-phase: product first appends the same-status
`BLOCKED -> BLOCKED` human-authorization row with a
`human_authorization: approved` note and an Active `max_fix_cycles` override in
one checkpoint; the `BLOCKED -> FIX_REQUESTED` dispatch occurs in a separate
later checkpoint. Each override state is append-only: append a new
`Active`, `Superseded`, or `Completed` line and never rewrite an older override
line in place. Every resumed-round `FIX_REQUEST` carries `cap_authorization:`
pointing to the authorization row and Active override.

## Missing-Dependency Gate

A `BLOCKED` on a missing tool or package is a distinct blocker type with a
built-in exit ramp, not a dead end. The lane records exactly what is missing and
the exact install command, distinguishing a `pip`-installable package from a
`system` binary that needs an installer/choco, and marks the `BLOCKED` message
with the greppable `blocker: missing_dependency` format (see
`references/protocol.md` "Missing-Dependency Blocker").

Core rule:

```text
missing dependency -> BLOCKED with install commands + ask the human, per loop-policy dependency_install
```

- `dependency_install` in `loop-policy.md` decides the flow: `ask` (default,
  always ask), `auto-pip-only` (may auto-install a `pip` package but always asks
  before a `system` binary), or `never` (never install; stay `BLOCKED`).
- Installing mutates the human's environment, so a `system` binary always needs
  explicit approval regardless of the knob.
- On approval, install, re-run the exact failed verify command, record fresh
  evidence, and unblock the SAME `request_id` with an incremented `iteration` -
  never a new request, and never accept on the assumption that the install
  worked. The completion gate must see real re-verified evidence.

## Heartbeat / Orphan Recovery

Each lane reports a heartbeat while it owns an active request. The authoritative heartbeat the doctor reads is the `heartbeat` column in `agent-lanes.md`; a lane's `current.md` `last_updated` is a per-lane mirror of the same value. A stale heartbeat means the owning thread crashed, compacted, or was abandoned.

Core rule:

```text
IMPLEMENTING request + stale lane heartbeat -> revert to REQUESTED for reassignment
```

- Refresh the heartbeat (the `heartbeat` column in `agent-lanes.md`, and the `last_updated` mirror in `current.md`) when claiming a request and at each checkpoint while implementing.
- A heartbeat is stale when it is older than the staleness window in `loop-policy.md` (or no later than the request's `updated_at`).
- On recovery, if a request is `IMPLEMENTING` (or `REVIEWING`) but its owner lane's heartbeat is stale, revert the request to `REQUESTED`, clear `owner_lane`, append the transition to the run log with a note, and let product reassign it.
- Do not reassign a request whose heartbeat is fresh; assume the owner is still working.
- Reverting for reassignment does not increment `iteration` and does not count against `max_fix_cycles`.

## Continuation Thread Health Check

Treat a returned thread ID as provisional until:

1. `create_thread` returns a thread ID.
2. `list_threads` or `read_thread` can find that exact ID or exact title.
3. `set_thread_title` succeeds, or `read_thread` confirms the title is already correct.
4. `read_thread` shows the first turn exists.
5. The first turn is `inProgress` or completed normally.
6. Recent items show the agent started reading the handoff, skill docs, or project files.

Only then write the ID into `agent-lanes.md`, `requests.md`, `handoff.md`, or the final response.

If the ID cannot be found, title updates fail repeatedly, or the thread becomes unreadable or unopenable:

- do not report it as the next session;
- mark any already-written ID as stale;
- create at most one replacement from the current handoff;
- verify the replacement before recording it.

## Recovery Gate

On resume, do not start by inventing a new plan. First read:

1. **Open the turn** using the single-source rule in `references/protocol.md` ("Open the turn").
2. `goal.md`
3. `tracker.md`
4. `constraints.md`
5. `handoff.md`
6. `agent-lanes.md`
7. `requests.md`
8. this lane's `current.md` and its `inbox/new/` (read sorted by filename) - the presence of a file in `inbox/new` is the source of truth for pending work (`references/protocol.md`, "Atomic Message Delivery"); consult the flat `inbox.md` only if Python was unavailable when a message was delivered

Continue the oldest non-terminal request owned by this lane. If ownership is unclear, ask product or mark `BLOCKED`.

If the optional decision cache is in use, follow the Memory Protocol pinned in `handoff.md` before acting on any recorded decision: grep `docs/loop/memory/decisions.jsonl` for the request, follow the `supersedes` chain to the newest live decision, and re-run the completion gate and doctor before trusting a recorded `gate_status`. A `stale_decision` warning means discard that cached decision and re-read the live source docs. (See `references/memory.md`.)

## Stop Conditions

This is the single complete Stop Conditions list. Stop and report clearly
instead of handing off or auto-chaining when:

- `Done When` is satisfied;
- tracker has no unchecked work;
- thread tools are unavailable and the durable fallback cannot be written;
- target lane lacks verified thread ID and thread creation is not allowed;
- the current checkpoint is not closed enough to hand off;
- verification cannot run, or any checkpoint verify command exits non-zero
  (mark the checkpoint `BLOCKED`, never accept with a caveat; emit
  `SHIP_CHECK_OK` only after the gate reads exit 0 for every required record);
- `budget_exhausted: true` is set in `loop-budget.md`;
- a required action needs credentials, approval, private external data,
  destructive changes, billing changes, or production deployment;
- write scopes conflict or lanes would need to write the same files;
- a lane is asked to change code with no backing request row (route it through
  the Human Direct-Ask Ritual first);
- the next action would violate `constraints.md`;
- `max_fix_cycles` is reached;
- the next request would be vague or unbounded;
- auto-chain would create an unbounded or duplicate continuation.
